    We're sorry, but your submission to the shared resources form did not process correctly.<br/>
    <br/>
    Here are the submission details:<br/>
    <!-- Please do not edit this code block. It automatically includes all the form response information from the submission that threw the exception -->
    <? var data = getDataContent(); ?>
    <? for (var i=0; i<data.length; i++) { ?>
    <?= data[i] ?><br/>
    <? } ?>
    <br/>
    The most likely cause of this error is that the resource has not been shared with the account specified in the form instructions. Please double-check your sharing settings, and fill in the form again. 
    Make sure that you allow editors to change the sharing settings, and that viewers can make a copy of the file.<br/>
    <br/>
    A tip to help you fill it in faster: in each of the responses, just press the down arrow on the keyboard to access a list of your entries. This will help you speed things up, instead of typing everything in again.<br/>
